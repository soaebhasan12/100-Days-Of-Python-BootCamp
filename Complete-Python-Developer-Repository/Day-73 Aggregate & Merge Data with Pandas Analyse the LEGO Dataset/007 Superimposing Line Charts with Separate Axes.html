<p>Wouldn't it be nice to have the number of themes and the number sets on the same chart?&nbsp;But what do we get if we just plot both of them the way we have before?&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://img-c.udemycdn.com/redactor/raw/2020-10-10_10-09-52-88792d77cb4c28acc03af46a6b2d56ae.png"></figure><p>Well, that's not very informative!  The problem is that the "number of themes" and the "number of sets" have very different scales. The theme number ranges between 0 and 90, while the number of sets ranges between 0 and 900. So what can we do?</p><p><strong>Two Separate Axes</strong></p><p>We need to be able to configure and plot our data on two separate axes on the same chart. This involves getting hold of an axis object from Matplotlib. </p><pre class="prettyprint linenums">ax1 = plt.gca() # get current axes
ax2 = ax1.twinx() </pre><p>We then create another axis object:&nbsp;<code>ax2</code>. The key thing is that by using the <code>.twinx() </code>method allows <code>ax1</code> and <code>ax2</code> to share the same x-axis. When we plot our data on the axes objects we get this:</p><figure><img src="https://img-c.udemycdn.com/redactor/raw/2020-10-10_10-10-43-589f6106c0887901abd3163e08d6244c.png"></figure><p>That's very nice!&nbsp;But there's one problem:&nbsp;we can't tell the lines apart because they have the same colour!&nbsp;Let's add some styling. Let's:</p><ul><li><p>colour in the lines</p></li><li><p>colour in the axes and</p></li><li><p>add some labels</p></li></ul><p> so that we can see what's going on. Here's what we get:</p><figure><img src="https://img-c.udemycdn.com/redactor/raw/2020-10-10_10-10-58-e17b80c3fdd70b4474a4d7dec275eacf.png"></figure>
