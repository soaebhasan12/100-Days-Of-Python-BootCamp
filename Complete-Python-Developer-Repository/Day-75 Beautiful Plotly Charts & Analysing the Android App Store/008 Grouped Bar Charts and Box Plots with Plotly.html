The median paid photography app earned about $20,000. Many more apps revenues were even lower - meaning they would need other sources of revenue like advertising or in-app purchases to make up for their development costs. However, certain app categories seem to contain a large number of outliers that have much higher (estimated) revenue - for example in Medical, Personalisation, Tools, Game, and Family.</p><figure><img src="https://img-c.udemycdn.com/redactor/raw/2020-10-11_13-55-50-fba0062772e999739ca28119fd0cecda.png" style="width: 100%;"></figure><p>So, if you were to list a paid app, how should you price it?
