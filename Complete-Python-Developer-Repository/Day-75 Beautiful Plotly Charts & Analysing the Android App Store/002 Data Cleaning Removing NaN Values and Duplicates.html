<p>The first step as always is getting a better idea about what we're dealing with.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Preliminary Data Exploration</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Challenge</strong>: How many rows and columns does df_apps have?

In the Ratings and Type columns there are NaN (Not a number values) and in the Price column we have dollar signs that will cause problems.</p><p><br></p><p>The <code>.sample(n)</code> method will give us n random rows. This is another handy way to inspect our DataFrame.</p><figure><img src="https://img-c.udemycdn.com/redactor/raw/2020-10-10_11-42-49-6f7378014bb37376d36b47f735e53063.png" style="width: 100%;"></figure><p><strong>Challenge</strong>: Remove the columns called Last_Updated and Android_Version from the DataFrame. We will not use these columns.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Challenge</strong>: How many rows have a NaN value (not-a-number) in the Rating column? Create DataFrame called <code>df_apps_clean</code> that does not include these rows.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>..</p><p>...</p><p>..</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Solution: Dropping Unused Columns and Removing NaN Values</strong></p><p><br></p><p>To remove the unwanted columns, we simply provide a list of the column names <code>['Last_Updated', Android_Ver']</code> to the <code>.drop()</code> method. By setting <code>axis=1</code> we are specifying that we want to drop certain columns.</p><figure><img src="https://img-c.udemycdn.com/redactor/raw/2020-10-10_11-46-45-e0bba8ef961e0d55342aa3015415781f.png" style="width: 100%;"></figure><p>To find and remove the rows with the NaN values we can create a subset of the DataFrame based on where <code>.isna()</code> evaluates to <code>True</code>. We see that NaN values in ratings are associated with no reviews (and no installs). That makes sense.</p><figure><img src="https://img-c.udemycdn.com/redactor/raw/2020-10-10_11-46-58-0b80c76b8e494af654b061e730950323.png" style="width: 100%;"></figure><p>We can drop the NaN values with <code>.dropna()</code>:</p><p><br></p><pre class="prettyprint linenums">df_apps_clean = df_apps.dropna()
df_apps_clean.shape</pre><p>This leaves us with 9,367 entries in our DataFrame. But there may be other problems with the data too:</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Challenge</strong>: Are there any duplicates in data? Check for duplicates using the <a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.duplicated.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">.duplicated()</a> function. How many entries can you find for the "Instagram" app? Use <a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.drop_duplicates.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">.drop_duplicates()</a> to remove any duplicates from <code>df_apps_clean</code>.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>..</p><p></p><p>..</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Solution: Finding and Removing Duplicates</strong></p><p><br></p><p>There are indeed duplicates in the data. We can show them using the <code>.duplicated()</code> method, which brings up 476 rows:</p><p><br></p><pre class="prettyprint linenums">duplicated_rows = df_apps_clean[df_apps_clean.duplicated()]
print(duplicated_rows.shape)
duplicated_rows.head()</pre><p><br></p><p>We can actually check for an individual app like Instagram by looking up all the entries with that name in the App column.</p><figure><img src="https://img-c.udemycdn.com/redactor/raw/2020-10-10_11-47-31-8c3f03dbcb7dd1fe7d38c6cc96a69a9a.png" style="width: 100%;"></figure><p>So how do we get rid of duplicates? Can we simply call <code>.drop_duplicates()</code>?</p><p><br></p><pre class="prettyprint linenums">df_apps_clean = df_apps_clean.drop_duplicates()</pre><p>Not really. If we do this without specifying how to identify duplicates, we see that 3 copies of Instagram are retained because they have a different number of reviews. We need to provide the column names that should be used in the comparison to identify duplicates. For example:</p><figure><img src="https://img-c.udemycdn.com/redactor/raw/2020-10-10_11-47-48-eb3f1b28243622d449e0958bc57ad4a5.png" style="width: 100%;"></figure><p>This leaves us with 8,199 entries after removing duplicates. Huzzah! </p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><strong>What else should I know about the data?</strong></p><p><br></p><p>So we can see that 13 different features were originally scraped from the Google Play Store.</p><p><br></p><ul><li><p>Obviously, the data is just a sample out of all the Android apps. It doesn't include all Android apps of which there are millions.</p></li><li><p>Ill assume that the sample is representative of the App Store as a whole. This is not necessarily the case as, during the web scraping process, this sample was served up based on geographical location and user behaviour of the person who scraped it - in our case Lavanya Gupta.</p></li><li><p>The data was compiled around 2017/2018. The pricing data reflect the price in USD Dollars at the time of scraping. (developers can offer promotions and change their apps pricing).</p></li><li><p>Ive converted the apps size to a floating-point number in MBs. If data was missing, it has been replaced by the average size for that category.</p></li><li><p>The installs are not the exact number of installs. If an app has 245,239 installs then Google will simply report an order of magnitude like 100,000+. Ive removed the '+' and well assume the exact number of installs in that column for simplicity.</p></li></ul><p><br></p><p>Heres what you would see under an Android app listing if you go to a listing on the Google Play Store:</p><figure><img src="https://img-c.udemycdn.com/redactor/raw/2020-10-10_11-48-11-f6ba2e6e8c46047d93a8c2d1baaa68d1.png" style="width: 100%;"></figure><figure><img src="https://img-c.udemycdn.com/redactor/raw/2020-10-10_11-48-18-97ccd1a03fd69d43ea1a1635e1e521d8.png" style="width: 100%;"></figure><p><br></p><p><br></p>
