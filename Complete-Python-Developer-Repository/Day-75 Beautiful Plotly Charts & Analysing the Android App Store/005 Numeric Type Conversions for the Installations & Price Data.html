However, because we are dealing with a non-numeric data type, the ordering is not helpful. The reason Python is not recognising our installs as numbers is because of the comma (<code>,</code>) characters.</p><figure><img height="782" src="https://img-c.udemycdn.com/redactor/raw/2020-10-11_12-25-56-6e1796e77c7c62d86add95c5bb702d61.png" width="589"></figure><p>We can remove the comma (<code>,</code>) character - or any character for that matter - from a DataFrame using the strings<a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.Series.str.replace.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"> .replace()</a> method.

There are 15 I am Rich Apps in the Google Play Store apparently. They all cost $300 or more, which is the main point of the app. The story goes that in 2008, Armin Heinrich released the very first I am Rich app in the iOS App Store for $999.90. The app does absolutely nothing. It just displays the picture of a gemstone and can be used to prove to your friends how rich you are. Armin actually made a total of 7 sales before the app was hastily removed by Apple. Nonetheless, it inspired a bunch of copycats on the Android App Store, but if you search today, youll find all of these apps have disappeared as well. The high installation numbers are likely gamed by making the app was available for free at some point to get reviews and appear more legitimate.</p><figure><img height="321" src="https://img-c.udemycdn.com/redactor/raw/2020-10-11_12-29-36-4a5ef8c85b0be30fd61421016efa78db.png" width="438"></figure><p>Leaving this bad data in our dataset will misrepresent our analysis of the most expensive 'real' apps.

df_apps_clean.sort_values('Revenue_Estimate', ascending=False)[:10]</pre><p>This generously assumes of course that all the installs would have been made at the listed price, which is unlikely, as there are always promotions and free give-aways on the App Stores.</p><figure><img src="https://img-c.udemycdn.com/redactor/raw/2020-10-11_12-31-03-0188ddd4b7556c427f69ca58b970ced5.png" style="width: 100%;"></figure><p>The top spot of the highest-grossing paid app goes to  Minecraft at close to $70 million. Its quite interesting that Minecraft (along with Bloons and Card Wars) is actually listed in the Family category rather than in the Game category. If we include these titles, we see that 7 out the top 10 highest-grossing apps are games. The Google Play Store seems to be quite flexible with its category labels.</p><figure><img height="503" src="https://img-c.udemycdn.com/redactor/raw/2020-10-11_12-43-12-4ad2dad147ff2056c53957aadd7fc38f.png" width="629"></figure><p><br></p>
