Let's investigate:</p><ul><li><p>How search volume for "Bitcoin" relates to the price of Bitcoin</p></li><li><p>How search volume for a hot stock like Telsa relates to that stock's price&nbsp;and</p></li><li><p>How searches for "Unemployment Benefits" vary with the actual unemployment rate in the United States</p></li></ul><p><br></p><p><strong>What you'll learn today</strong></p><ul><li><p>How to make time-series data comparable by resampling and converting to the same periodicity (e.g., from daily data to monthly data). </p></li><li><p>Fine-tuning the styling of Matplotlib charts by using limits, labels, linestyles, markers, colours, and the chart's resolution.</p></li><li><p>Using grids to help visually identify seasonality in a time series.</p></li><li><p>Finding the number of missing and NaN values and how to locate NaN&nbsp;values in a DataFrame. </p></li><li><p>How to work with Locators to better style the time axis on a chart </p></li><li><p>Review the concepts learned in the previous three days and apply them to new datasets</p></li></ul><p><br></p><p><strong>Download and add the Notebook to Google Drive</strong></p><p>Download the .zip file from this lesson and extract it.
