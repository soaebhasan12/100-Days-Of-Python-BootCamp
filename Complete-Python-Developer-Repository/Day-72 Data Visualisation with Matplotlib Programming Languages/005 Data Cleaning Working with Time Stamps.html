<p><strong>Selecting an Individual Cell</strong></p><p>Let's take a closer look at the 'DATE' column in our DataFrame. We can use the double square bracket notation to look at the second entry in the column:&nbsp;</p><pre class="prettyprint linenums">df['DATE'][1]</pre><p>Alternatively, for column names no spaces, we can also use the dot-notation:</p><pre class="prettyprint linenums">df.DATE[1]</pre><p>I prefer the square bracket notation for column names since it's more flexible, but with the dot notation, you get to use autocomplete, which is also nice.</p><p><br></p><figure><img src="https://img-c.udemycdn.com/redactor/raw/2020-09-23_11-56-27-154946ab0ee26941481e132d488e3049.png" style="width: 100%;"></figure><p><strong>Inspecting the Data Type</strong></p><p>When we type check the contents of this cell, we see that we are not dealing with a date object, but rather with a string. </p><figure><img src="https://img-c.udemycdn.com/redactor/raw/2020-09-23_11-58-49-85cfb3f4fd4167f591789e228b718b16.png" style="width: 100%;"></figure><p>This is not very handy. Not only will the string format always show the unnecessary 00:00:00, but we also don't get the benefit of working with Datetime objects, which know how to handle dates and times. Pandas can help us convert the string to a timestamp using the <a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.to_datetime.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">to_datetime()</a> method. </p><p>Here's how we can convert the entry in our cell and check that it worked:</p><figure><img src="https://img-c.udemycdn.com/redactor/raw/2020-09-23_13-43-08-b0e4ee7ca77200303a59fd33923b3847.png" style="width: 100%;"></figure><p>Let's use Pandas' <code>to_datetime()</code> to convert the entire <code>df['DATE']</code> column. </p><figure><img src="https://img-c.udemycdn.com/redactor/raw/2020-09-23_13-49-24-59422ce38b28d0ca79ac20c33f208996.png" style="width: 100%;"></figure><p>Excellent. Now we can start thinking about how to manipulate our data so that we get a one column per programming language. For all of that and more, I'll see you in the next lesson. </p>
