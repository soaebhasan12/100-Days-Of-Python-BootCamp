<p>Looking at our chart we see that time-series data can be quite noisy, with a lot of up and down spikes. This can sometimes make it difficult to see what's going on. </p><p>A useful technique to make a trend apparent is to smooth out the observations by taking an average. By averaging say, 6 or 12 observations we can construct something called the rolling mean. Essentially we calculate the average in a window of time and move it forward by one observation at a time. </p><p>Since this is such a common technique, Pandas actually two handy methods already built-in: <a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.rolling.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">rolling()</a> and <a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.core.window.rolling.Rolling.mean.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">mean()</a>. We can chain these two methods up to create a DataFrame made up of the averaged observations. </p><pre class="prettyprint linenums"># The window is number of observations that are averaged
