<p><strong>Open the Template</strong></p><p>To help you with your Data Science journey I'll provide you with starter notebook which already has some of the sections and challenges laid out. Download the .zip file from this lesson's resources, unzip it, and upload it to Google Drive. There you can open the file as a Colab Notebook.</p><figure><img src="https://img-c.udemycdn.com/redactor/raw/2020-09-23_10-30-41-7cd880da752b2f92c65e49ea64dda10b.gif" style="width: 100%;"></figure><p><br></p><p><strong>Import the Data</strong></p><p>In this lesson, I've also included a QueryResults.csv file with the Stack Overflow data that we'll be using. Download this .csv and add it to your notebook. </p><figure><img src="https://img-c.udemycdn.com/redactor/raw/2020-09-23_11-05-34-8d9a560587801de46db30f7165f1c70e.gif" style="width: 100%;"></figure><p><br></p><h4>Challenge</h4><p><br></p><p>For the next steps, let's review the data exploration that we've done yesterday:</p><ul><li><p>Read the .csv file and store it in a Pandas DataFrame called <code>df</code>. Have a look at the <a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.read_csv.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">read_csv() documentation</a> and try to provide these column names:&nbsp;<code>['DATE', 'TAG', 'POSTS']</code></p></li><li><p>Look at the first and last 5 rows of the DataFrame.</p></li><li><p>How many rows and how many columns does it have?</p></li><li><p>Count the number of entries in each column.</p></li></ul>
